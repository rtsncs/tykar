  # A Socket handler
  #
  # It's possible to control the websocket connection and
  # assign values that can be accessed by your channel topics.

  ## Channels
  # Uncomment the following line to define a "room:*" topic
  # pointing to the `TykarWeb.RoomChannel`:
  #
  # channel "room:*", TykarWeb.RoomChannel
  #
  # To create a channel file, use the mix task:
  #
  #     mix phx.gen.channel Room
  #
  # See the [`Channels guide`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html)
  # for further details.

  channel "makao_room:lobby", TykarWeb.MakaoRoomChannel

  # Socket params are passed from the client and can
  # be used to verify and authenticate a user. After
  # verification, you can put default assigns into
  # the socket that will be set for all channels, ie
  #
  #     {:ok, assign(socket, :user_id, verified_user_id)}
  #
  # To deny connection, return `:error` or `{:error, term}`. To control the
  # response the client receives in that case, [define an error handler in the
  # websocket
  # configuration](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Endpoint.html#socket/3-websocket-configuration).
  #
  # See `Phoenix.Token` documentation for examples in
  # performing token verification on connect.

  # Socket IDs are topics that allow you to identify all sockets for a given user:

  # all active sockets and channels for a given user:
  #
  #     Elixir.TykarWeb.Endpoint.broadcast("user_socket:#{user.id}", "disconnect", %{})
  #
  # Returning `nil` makes this socket anonymous.
